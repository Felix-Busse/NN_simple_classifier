# NN_simple_classifier

**Neuronal network classifier** for data generated from Gaussian or Lorenz distribution

## How to
Clone this repository and explore the classification by neuronal network in [Jupyter-Notebook](classifier_skript.ipynb).

## Description
### Data generation
Data is generated as points taken from a gaussian or lorenz distribution. The free parameters of the distributions is altered during data generation.

### Classification
**Hyperparameter** selection, use of **metrics** and **visualizing performances** of neuronal networks is demonstrated.
